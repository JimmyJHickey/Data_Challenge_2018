The purpose of this document is to show some visualizations that give an overview of and breakdown of the data. 

[//]: # Gross inline styling. I'm so sorry.

<span style = "color:red">***WARNING***</span>: These visualizations will not look pretty. Also, I don't know how to manipulate images in RMarkdown yet. Sorry.


 ![Dead Status Distribution][deadstatus_distribution]
 
 Status seems fairly evenly distributed, so don't need to worry too much about poor sampling in CV and bootstrapping. 
 
 
 ![Gender Distribution][gender_distribution]      
 
 More males than females  

 
 ![Histology Distribution][histology_distribution]  
 
 Squamous cell is the most represented
 
 ![Overall Stage Distribution][overallstage_distribution]  
 
 Most subjects in stage IIIb

 
 ![Survival Time Distribution][survivaltime_distribution]  
 
 Most people in earlier survival times (binned by 100s). Also, all dead in first few.
